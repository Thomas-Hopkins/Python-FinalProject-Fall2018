#Python Calculator 
Final class project python Fall 2018. Co-Authored with Rania Jameel.

This calculator has 3 main modules: The standard calculator interface, a note 
taking utility, and a very basic visual graphing calculator. 

#Dependencies
The graphing calculator portion of this project requires two dependencies for
working with complex algebraic expressions. Alternatively, you may run it without
the graphing calculator with args -nograph
